# :wave: Hi there, I'm Gary.

#### 🌱 I am a software engineer currently with a focus on full-stack development.

2023 will be my final year as a Computer Science and Economics double major at UC San Diego. 

While I'm searching for an internship to accompany my final year, I've been working on some stuff! 
If you're interested in any of my work, I've listed some of my recent endeavors below. 

Feel free to check them out! <br clear="left"/>

☀️ Things I'm currently working on & learning about:
- 📖: [Sniip](http://mangasnip.herokuapp.com/), a manga start-up currently entering seeding, focused on bringing popular manga exclusive to Japan to an international market.
- 🌳: [Python ML](), 
- :evergreen_tree:: [Drop-Box Clone](), a horizontal scalable networked file system using multiple servers, consistent hashing (hash rings), and [client]() used to sync directories to the cloud through RPCs.
